<h2>The Enchanted Forest</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The Enchanted Forest needs more light, collect 100 fireflies without collecting more than 4 spiders, to light up the forest, don't forget to close the jar once you've collected them all!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to remember their childhood and the joy catching fireflies brought them.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
It's a children's game related to nature.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
It's evaluating concentration and patience.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It has a unique concept and vibrant colors that create a calming atmosphere.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
    
The world is an enchanted forest that requires you find natural lighting from the fireflies to find your way home through the forest. The game is abstract in that it pulls concepts that draw on the chil
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The dramatic tension is the forest needs light, and the fireflies are falling from the trees at fast speeds, but they aren't the only entities falling. The firefly's enemy, the spider, is also trying to fall into the jar, if you collect more than 4 of the spiders, all the fireflies die and you lose the game, so be careful with what you pick up!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is children aged 3 and up.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
It probably takes about 3-5 minutes to win, depending on whether the player loses the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Patience, concentration, and desire to win.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I found the majority of the assets from google, I didn't use any  of the phaser examples except the emitter example to create the falling effect of the assets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed from the emitter example on Phaser, but other than that no other "close" game ideas.
